# 🥗 Diet Recommendation System

A content-based recommendation system built with Python to suggest personalized meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks) based on user profile inputs like age, weight, activity level, and dietary preferences.

## 📁 Files Included

- `Food_and_Nutrition__.csv`: Dataset with meal plans and nutritional info.
- `diet_recommendation_model.pkl`: Pickled model for reuse.
- `requirements.txt`: Required Python libraries.

## 🔧 How It Works

The model:
